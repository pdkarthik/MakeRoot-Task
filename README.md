The MakeRoot-assignment project is a web-based interactive color assignment game called "Color Button Assignment".

📖 Project Purpose

This project demonstrates event-driven UI logic and state management in a frontend application by allowing users to sequentially assign colors to a grid of buttons.

🎮 What the Web App Contains

- Color Sequence Assignment:

  Users assign each of the nine buttons a color by clicking them. The current color to be assigned follows a fixed sequence (coral, teal, purple, orange, pink, blue, green, brown, indigo).

- UI Components:

  - A displayed color palette showing the assignment order and current color.

  - A 3x3 grid of buttons (Button 1 to Button 9) available for color assignment.

  - "Reset Grid" button to clear assignments and restart the process.

  - Progress indicator showing how many of the nine colors have been assigned.

- User Guidance:

  Instructions above the grid prompt the user to click a button to assign the next color in the sequence.

- Visual Feedback:

  The interface highlights the next color and visually tracks completion progress.


This project serves as a simple interactive demo for sequential UI state progression, suitable for showcasing basic React or JavaScript UI programming skills.
